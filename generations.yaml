generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 1991
    end_year: 2002
    description: "The original Mitsubishi RVR was introduced in Japan as a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) with a tall wagon-like body style. The name RVR stood for 'Recreation Vehicle Runner.' Available in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations, it offered versatile interior space despite relatively compact exterior dimensions. Powertrain options included various four-cylinder engines, with performance variants featuring the turbocharged 4G63 engine shared with the Lancer Evolution, producing up to 240 horsepower in the RVR Hyper Sports Gear R trim. The first generation evolved through several updates, with the 'New RVR' from 1997-2002 featuring revised styling and updated powertrains. This generation was marketed in some export markets as the Mitsubishi Space Runner or Expo LRV, though with limited distribution outside Japan and select Asian markets. The original RVR established Mitsubishi's presence in the recreational vehicle segment in Japan, offering a combination of utility, performance options, and compact dimensions ideal for urban use."

  - name: "Second Generation (GA)"
    start_year: 2010
    end_year: 2023
    description: "After an eight-year hiatus, the RVR nameplate was revived for a completely different vehicleâ€”a compact crossover SUV marketed globally under various names including ASX in Europe and Outlander Sport in North America. Built on a shortened version of the Outlander's GS platform, it featured distinctive styling with Mitsubishi's 'jet fighter' front grille design and a more conventional crossover silhouette compared to the MPV-style original. In Japan, it was primarily powered by a 1.8L MIVEC four-cylinder engine, with later updates adding smaller displacement options and improved efficiency. Transmission choices included CVT and manual options depending on the market, with both front-wheel drive and electronically controlled all-wheel drive available. The interior offered straightforward functionality with a focus on practicality, featuring flexible seating and cargo configurations. The second-generation RVR received several significant updates throughout its unusually long production run, with refreshes in 2013, 2016, and a more substantial redesign in 2020 bringing elements of Mitsubishi's Dynamic Shield design language, updated technology, and refined powertrains. Despite its age compared to competitors, the RVR maintained popularity in Japan and global markets due to its combination of compact dimensions, practical utility, value pricing, and available all-wheel drive capability."

    description: "The third-generation RVR represents a complete redesign, now based on the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance CMF-B platform shared with various compact models across the Alliance brands. Featuring Mitsubishi's latest interpretation of the Dynamic Shield design language, it presents a more contemporary appearance with distinctive LED lighting signatures, bold surface treatment, and a modern crossover profile. Powertrain options in the Japanese market include a 1.5-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine, with hybrid and potentially full electric variants planned as part of Mitsubishi's electrification strategy. All-wheel drive continues to be available through an updated version of Mitsubishi's electronically controlled system. The interior represents a significant advancement with higher quality materials, improved technology including a larger touchscreen infotainment system with connected services, digital instrument cluster options, and enhanced driver assistance systems. Despite growth in technology and features, the new RVR maintains compact dimensions suited to Japanese and urban markets. This generation benefits from the shared development resources of the Alliance partnership while maintaining Mitsubishi's distinctive design character and focus on all-weather capability, positioning the RVR to compete more effectively in the highly competitive compact crossover segment."
