  - name: "First Generation"

    end_year: 2002
    description: "The original Mitsubishi RVR was introduced in Japan as a compact multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) with a tall wagon-like body style. The name RVR stood for 'Recreation Vehicle Runner.' Available in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations, it offered versatile interior space despite relatively compact exterior dimensions. Powertrain options included various four-cylinder engines, with performance variants featuring the turbocharged 4G63 engine shared with the Lancer Evolution, producing up to 240 horsepower in the RVR Hyper Sports Gear R trim. The first generation evolved through several updates, with the 'New RVR' from 1997-2002 featuring revised styling and updated powertrains. This generation was marketed in some export markets as the Mitsubishi Space Runner or Expo LRV, though with limited distribution outside Japan and select Asian markets. The original RVR established Mitsubishi's presence in the recreational vehicle segment in Japan, offering a combination of utility, performance options, and compact dimensions ideal for urban use."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2010
    end_year: 2024
    description: "After an eight-year hiatus, the RVR nameplate was revived for a completely different vehicle—a compact crossover SUV marketed globally under various names including ASX in Europe and Outlander Sport in North America. Built on a shortened version of the Outlander's GS platform, it featured distinctive styling with Mitsubishi's 'jet fighter' front grille design and a more conventional crossover silhouette compared to the MPV-style original. In Japan, it was primarily powered by a 1.8L MIVEC four-cylinder engine, with later updates adding smaller displacement options and improved efficiency. Transmission choices included CVT and manual options depending on the market, with both front-wheel drive and electronically controlled all-wheel drive available. The interior offered straightforward functionality with a focus on practicality, featuring flexible seating and cargo configurations. The second-generation RVR received several significant updates throughout its unusually long production run, with refreshes in 2013, 2016, and a more substantial redesign in 2020 bringing elements of Mitsubishi's Dynamic Shield design language, updated technology, and refined powertrains. Despite its age compared to competitors, the RVR maintained popularity in Japan and global markets due to its combination of compact dimensions, practical utility, value pricing, and available all-wheel drive capability."
